# Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

* Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!

* Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.

* Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.

* Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.

* Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

* Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.
